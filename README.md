# MALBot

A Discord bot by HxHexa using the MyAnimeList Official API and Jikai Unofficial MAL API. It only has the sole function to look up information on an anime or manga on MAL. Uses [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py).

### Commands

@MALBot anime <anime_name>

@MALBot manga <manga_name>

#### Afterthoughts
MALBot, or MyAnimeList bot. This one was something I started all the way back in Fall of 2017 apparently. I got it working, but never actually managed to know how to install it in a different server. Looking back on it, I am actually pretty proud of myself. I basically just downloaded a bunch of source code from different people, and just in general tried to figure my way out from picking bits and pieces from different places (with help from the discord.py documentations as well as the Discord Dev server, of course).

According to my "example" folder, thank you
